        <h1>Witney: Guide to Election Day Activities</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>Thank you so much for volunteering to help on election day. Witney will be decided by a small number of votes this year, <strong>so what you do could make the difference.</strong></p>

        <h2>Key Mission</h2>
        <p>The key mission on election day between 7am-10pm is to make sure as many likely Lib Dem voters as possible have voted. More people than you expect forget that it is polling day, and others may not realise how close it is this year and that this time their vote matters.</p>

        <h2>Committee Room</h2>
        <p>Our activities are coordinated from our committee room. <p>Here you'll be able to get a cup of tea, and a biscuit or two! There is no need to go to the committee room before your shift of telling or knocking up, but <strong>you are welcome to pop in at any time for help</strong>, a rest or to charge your phone.</p>

        <h2>Key Actions to Get Out the Vote</h2>

        <h3>1. Good Morning Leaflets</h3>
        <p>These remind people that it is polling day and are targeted to likely Lib Dem voters. They are delivered between 5am and 9am.</p>
        <p class="emphasis"><strong>We are currently short of deliverers for these, so if you can help please let us know.</strong></p>

        <h3>2. Knocking Up</h3>
        <p>This is the process of reminding selected people at their doorstep to vote. This is the key activity and we need as many people as possible to help with this. If you have a telling slot, you can <strong>knock up before and after your slot if possible.</strong></p>
        <p>Most people find it quite fun and rewarding, and it is surprising how many people are pleased to be reminded to vote! <strong>If you are new to this, we can pair you with someone who has done it before</strong> until you get the hang of it.</p>
        <p>This is done throughout the day, but particularly after 5pm when more people are likely to be home. We are allowed to persuade people on the day - except near polling stations.</p>
        <p>For motivating people to vote it could be useful to refer to the polls at <a href="https://witneypolls.com">witneypolls.com</a></p>
        <p>The list of people to knock on is managed on an app called <strong>MiniVAN</strong>, after knocking you record their response on the app. For a guide on using it, visit <a href="https://tech.libdems.org.uk/training/connect/toolkit/using-minivan">this link</a>. If you have any issues or want help setting up, or talked through using MiniVAN please pop by the committee room.</p>
        <p>As you will be using your phone, <strong>bring a power bank if you have one, and make sure your phone is charged.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>If they are out</strong> you can leave a "we called" leaflet - these can be collected from the commitee room</p>

        <h3>3. Tellers</h3>
        <p>We need people at the polling stations who record who has voted. This information is used so the knock-up team can focus on those who have not voted.</p>
        <h4>How it works:</h4>
        <p>There is a <strong>rota of tellers</strong> which will be shared on the WhatsApp channel. If you are running late or unable to make your slot please let us know.
            When it is time for your slot please <strong>arrive a few minutes early to take over from the person before you.</strong> They will have a clipboard with telling sheets and a rosette that you wear so you are not confused with polling staff.
            As voters arrive at the station you ask for their polling number, which is printed on their polling card. You write this number on the telling sheet, as clearly as possible.</p>
        <ul>    
            <li>Voters are <strong>not required to give this info</strong>. If they refuse, just say "no problem" and move on.</li>
            <li><strong>You should not ask for any other information</strong>, and should not engage in any conversation about the election or politics.</li>
            <li>If they do not have their polling card, make a note of house number/name and postcode and gender M/F in the separate section of the sheet for this. Multiple people from one house can be marked e.g. "2F/3M"</li>
            <li>You should <strong>never be inside the polling station</strong> in your role as teller.</li>
            <li> If a voter asks what you are doing, just say that it is so they are not disturbed later in the day with a reminder.</li>
            <li> Tellers from other parties will be telling too. Normally they are polite and friendly, and at busy times it is usual to swap missed voters with them, for example if either of you needs the loo!</li>
            <li> Sometimes voters will volunteer that they have voted Lib Dem, if so write "LD" next to their entry on the sheet. Never ask for this information, or discuss any further with them.</li>
            <li> Every hour, or when the sheet is full, you should <strong>take a photo of the sheet and send it to the WhatsApp 
                group</strong> at <a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/EOHHsHmoqYPABgfsvo4lNI"><strong>this link</strong></a> or the QR code below. 
                Please make this is a clear picture. Draw a line under those numbers which have been photographed and sent.
                Please only use this group for sending telling list pictures. You can mute this group (press three dots at the top of the group then "Mute notifications") to stop unwanted notifications.
                All pictures should be deleted after polling day.
            </li>
            <li> Don't worry if you miss one or two numbers while sending the photos, or at very busy times. The aim is to get the bulk of them.</li>
            <li> At the end of your shift you should <strong>hand over the sheets and rosette to the next teller.</strong></li>
            <li> Any concerns on the day - get in touch. </li>
        </ul>
